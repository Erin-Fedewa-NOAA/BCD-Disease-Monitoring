#Correlation between visual EBS-wide timeseries and index site prevalence 
   
#To do:
#calculate annual visual prevalence via ESP script - add NBS
#use model estimates for EBS and NBS annual prevelance 
#test for syncrony in timeseries with correlation
#test for relationship with linear model 

#subset visual dataset for same size/sampling criteria for blood draws
#filter visual dataset for index site stations only for more refined comparision
