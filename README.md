# Bitter crab disease monitoring in Bering Sea snow crab
This dataset combines the former AFSC Pathobiology Program bitter crab disease detection efforts (2014-2017; conventional PCR) and Virginia Institute of Marine Science bitter crab disease detection efforts (2018-2023; conventional and digital PCR) to estimate disease prevelance in index monitoring sites, investigate potential drivers of bitter crab disease, and assess the accuracy and sensitivity of visual diagnostic methods. Many analyses using this combined dataset are leveraged from Fedewa et al. 2025, [Bitter crab disease dynamics in eastern Bering Sea Tanner and snow crab: An underestimated and emergent stressor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016578362500044X).
